# Space-Missions Analysis
This project aims to analyze and visualize trends in space mission data from an Excel file containing information about satellite missions. The analysis focuses on exploring mission outcomes, countries' involvement, and types of missions conducted over time.

Dataset
The dataset is stored in an Excel file named space_missions.xlsx and contains information about various aspects of satellite missions, including satellite names, countries of operation, mission purposes, launch dates, and more.

# Getting Started

Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib
Place the Excel file (space_missions.xlsx) containing the space mission data in the project directory.

Run the Python script main.py to analyze and visualize the space mission data:


python main.py

# Analysis
The analysis includes the following visualizations:

Top 10 Mission Purposes:

1. A bar chart showing the top 10 mission purposes based on the 'Purpose' column in the dataset.
Top 10 Countries with Most Space Missions:

2. A bar chart showing the top 10 countries with the most space missions based on the 'Country of Operator/Owner' column in the dataset.
Distribution of Mission Orbits:

3. A pie chart showing the distribution of mission orbits based on the 'Class of Orbit' column in the dataset.

4. A plot of the number of missions over time
